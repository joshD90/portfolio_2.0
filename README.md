# portfolio_2.0
## Overview
A revamp of an old Portfolio with an attempt at making a more professional, clean focussed website.
This project was undertaken in Typescript and stands as a solo React Frontend Piece with Tailwind for CSS.  For me I have always focussed on design over coding and so this was a nice opportunity for me to explore good better design choices.  I had felt that the previous one was a bit 'tacky' and overstated so I wished to present something which stood out however still held to being subtle.

## Features
The banner page is simplistic yet with the central split, complimentary sides and varying fonts it draws the user in.  Call to action is very evident and for purpose with encouragement to scroll further.  The navbar was inspired by Sean Halpin.xyz and fits in with the centralized theme of the banner.

Projects section is laid out in grid format with subtle animations showing they are clickable and hoverable.  Each project can be clicked for more detail and a third party library is used, 'Swiper' in order to showcase the highlights.  I used framer motion for animating throughout the site and tried to keep these on the minimilistic side.

A contact page is available which is linked to my email utilizing formspree as I did not want to solely create a backend just for this purpose.
